= Exercise 1.0 - Installing Ansible Core and Ad-hoc commands

== Installing Ansible Core

Before we can use ansible to run some stuff, we've got to get Ansible installed.
Follow these few, simple steps and you should be good to go.  If you have trouble, let
one of your instructors know and we'll get you sorted.

[NOTE]
====
* Login to your control node
- ```ssh <username>@<IP of your control node>```
* Install Ansible Core
- ```sudo yum install -y ansible```

====

== Running Ad-hoc commands
Now that you've got ansible installed and working locally, we are going to start messing with your endpoints (your other two nodes)
by running some ad-hoc commands.

[NOTE]
====
* Reach out and say hi using the ping module
- ```ansible web -m ping```
* Install the EPEL repository package using the yum module
- ```ansible web -b -m yum -a "name=https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm state=present"```
* Install Nginx using the yum module
- ```ansible web -b -m yum -a "name=nginx state=present"```
* Start the Nginx service using the service module
- ```ansible web -b -m service -a "name=nginx state=started"```
