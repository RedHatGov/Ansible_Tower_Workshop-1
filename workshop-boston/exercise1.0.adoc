= Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hoc commands

****


For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get
a feel for how Ansible works.  Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks
on remote nodes without having to write a playbook.  They are very useful when you
simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.


====
Step 1: Take a look at your web node's configuration.  The ```setup``` module displays ansible facts about an endpoint.
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m setup
----
Step 2: Now, let's install Apache using the ```yum``` module
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b
----
Step 3: OK, Apache is installed now so let's start it up using the ```service``` module
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b
----
Step 4: Finally, let's clean up after ourselves.  First, stop the httpd service
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped" -b
----
Step 5: Next, remove the Apache package
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent" -b
