= Exercise 1.2 - Running Your Playbook

****
We are now going to run you're brand spankin' new playbook on your two web nodes.  To do this,
 you are going to use the ```ansible-playbook``` command.
====
Step 1: From your playbook directory ( ```~/apache_basic``` ), run your playbook.
----
ansible-playbook -i ./hosts -k install_apache.yml
----
====

However, before you go ahead and run that command, lets take a few moments to understand the options.

- *-i* This option allows you to specify the inventory file you wish to use.
- *-k* This option prompts you for the password of the user running the playbook.

OK, go ahead and run your playbook as specified in *Step 1*

In standard output, you should see something that looks very similar to the following:

Notice that the play and each task is named so that you can see what is being done and to which node it is being done to.
