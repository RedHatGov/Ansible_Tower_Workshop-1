= Exercise 1.2 - Running Your Playbook

****
We are now going to run you're brand spankin' new playbook on your two web nodes.  To do this,
 you are going to use the ```ansible-playbook``` command.
====
*Step 1:* From your playbook directory ( ```~/apache_basic``` ), run your playbook.
----
ansible-playbook -i ./hosts -k install_apache.yml
----
====

However, before you go ahead and run that command, lets take a few moments to understand the options.

- *-i* This option allows you to specify the inventory file you wish to use.
- *-k* This option prompts you for the password of the user running the playbook.

---
OK, go ahead and run your playbook as specified in *Step 1*

In standard output, you should see something that looks very similar to the following:

image::stdout_1.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title="apache_basic playbook stdout"]

Notice that the play and each task is named so that you can see what is being done and to which node it is being done to.
You also may notice a task in there that you didn't write <cough> ```setup``` <cough>.  This is because the ```setup``` module
runs by default.  To turn if off, you can specify link:{gather_facts-url}[gather_facts: false] in your play definition like this:
[source,yaml]
----
  ---
    - hosts: web
      name: Install the apache web service
      become: yes
      gather_facts: false
----

*Step 2:* Remove Apache

OK, for the next several minutes or as much time as we can afford, we want to to experiment a little.
We would like you to reverse what you've done, i.e. uninstall apache on your web nodes.
So, go ahead and edit your playbook and then when your finished, rerun it as specified in *Step 1*.
For this exercise we aren't going to show you line by line, but we will give you a few hints.


- If ```present``` makes sure a package is installed, then what option ensures it is removed?  Er... starts with an *ab*, ends with a *sent*
- If ```started``` makes sure a service is started, then what option ensures it is stopped?

Feel free to browse the help pages to see a list of all options.
