== The Tower UI

There are a number of contructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc.
However, we are only going to focus on a few of these key contructs that are required for this workshop today.
These are in bold below.

=== Settings

The `settings` menu (the little gear in the top right corner) is where you do a lot of your initial work to configure Ansible Tower. Within it are 8 options (9 if you include 'About')

We won't need to cover them all, but a few are key for us to be able to effectively use Tower today.

. Settings Options
* Organizations - Create Logical Organizations within Tower
* *Users - Manage Users, including their permissions*
* Teams - Create and manage Teams
* *Credentials - Manage multiple types of credentials (more on that later)*
* Management Jobs - cleaning up the Tower Database
* Inventory Scripts - Maintain dynamic inventory from your various cloud providers
* Notifications - Manage various kinds of notifications like Email, SMS, and Slack
* *View your License Info*
* About Tower

=== Configuration

To sucessfully run our playbooks from Tower, we'll need to make implement a few configurations.
The next few exercises will walk us through the configurations of:

* Projects
* Inventory
* Job Templates
