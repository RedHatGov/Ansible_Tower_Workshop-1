The Tower UI

There are a number of contructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc.
However, we are only going to focus on a few of the key contructs that are required for this workshop today.

Creating a Credential

Credentials are utilized by Tower for authentication when launching jobs against machines,
synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

Creating a Project

A Project is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks, represented in Tower.
You can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them manually
under the Project Base Path on your Tower server, or by placing your playbooks into
a source code management (SCM) system supported by Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.
====
*Step 1:* Click on PROJECTS +

*Step 4:* Select SAVE

Creating a Inventory

An inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs may be launched.
Inventories are divided into groups and these groups contain the actual hosts.
Groups may be sourced manually, by entering host names into Tower, or from one
of Ansible Towerâ€™s supported cloud providers.

An Inventory can also be imported into Tower using the ```tower-manage``` command
and this is how we are going to add an inventory for this workshop.

====
*Step 1:* Click on INVENTORIES <insert icon> +
*Step 2:* Select ADD <insert icon> +
*Step 3:* Complete the form using the following entries +

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Inventory
|DESCRIPTION|Boston workshop hosts
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|===
<insert image> +
*Step 4:* Select SAVE +
*Step 5:* Using ssh, login to your control node +
----
ssh <username>@<IP_Address_of_your_control_node>
----
*Step 6:* Use the ```tower-manage``` command to import an existing inventory.  (_Be sure to replace <username> with your actual username_)
----
sudo tower-manage inventory_import --source=/home/<username>/lightbulb/inventory --inventory-name="Ansible Workshop Inventory"
----

You should see output similar to the following: +

Feel free to browse your inventory in Tower.  You should now notice that the inventory has been populated with Groups and that
each of those groups contain hosts.

=== End Result

At this point, we are doing with our basic configuration of Ansible Tower.  In exercise 1.5, we will be soley focused on
creating and running a job template so you can see Tower in action.
