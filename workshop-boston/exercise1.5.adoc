= Exercise 1.3 - Installing Ansible Tower

In this exercise, we are going to get Ansible Tower installed on your control node

[NOTE]
====
* ssh into your control node
* Change directories to /tmp
* Download the latest Ansible Tower package
- ```curl -O http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz```
* Untar and unzip the package file
- ```tar xvfz /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz```
* Change directories into the ansible tower package
- ```cd /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-<version number>```
* Using an editor of your choice, open the inventory file
- ```vi /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-<version number>/inventory```
* fill a few variables out in an inventory file: ```admin_password, redis_password, pg_password```

.inventory
[source,yaml]
----
[primary]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[secondary]

[database]

[all:vars]
admin_password='ansibleWS'
redis_password='ansibleWS'

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database=awx
pg_username=awx
pg_password='ansibleWS'
----
* run the Ansible Tower setup script
- ```/tmp/ansible-tower-setup-<version number>/setup.sh```
* Download your license key
- ```curl -O {license_url}```

== The Tower UI

There are a number of contructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc.
However, we are only going to focus on a few of these key contructs that are required for this workshop today.
These are in bold below.

=== Settings

The `settings` menu (the little gear in the top right corner) is where you do a lot of your initial work to configure Ansible Tower. Within it are 8 options (9 if you include 'About')

We won't need to cover them all, but a few are key for us to be able to effectively use Tower today.

. Settings Options
* Organizations - Create Logical Organizations within Tower
* *Users - Manage Users, including their permissions*
* Teams - Create and manage Teams
* *Credentials - Manage multiple types of credentials (more on that later)*
* Management Jobs - cleaning up the Tower Database
* Inventory Scripts - Maintain dynamic inventory from your various cloud providers
* Notifications - Manage various kinds of notifications like Email, SMS, and Slack
* *View your License Info*
* About Tower

=== Configuration

To sucessfully run our playbooks from Tower, we'll need to make implement a few configurations.
The next few exercises will walk us through the configurations of:

* Projects
* Inventory
* Job Templates
