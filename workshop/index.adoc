.Before We Get Started
****

Overview

Today is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Ansible, whether you have used it or not. We are going to start with a short overview (yes, slideware) and then we'll get into the lab as soon as possible. That is where we will spend most of our time.

[.lead]
Your Responsibilities

* Have a discussion. This will be boring if it's just us up here talking for over 2 hours.
* Participate. We are going to cut you loose in a live Ansible Tower instance here in just a little while. Have questions. Have opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy. See? Not only can we dig into Ansible but you can make a new friend!
