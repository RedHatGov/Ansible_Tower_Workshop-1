= Job Templates

This is where the rubber meets the road. A job template combines all of the things we just set up, including:

* machine credentials
* cloud credentials
* playbooks from your project's source SCM
* inventories

It then brings them all together, to provide a platform for effectively managing your infrastructure. Job Templates also have the ability to limit which hosts are acted on in multiple ways and configure all of the 'normal' Ansible things like whether or not a job is run with privilege escalation.

* First, create the job template, as shown in the figure, above.
* Next, create another job template, as shown in the figure, above, but name it 'job-provision-ec2-instances-odd'.
* This will double the speed of job execution, due to the single-tasking nature of the job execution engine.

* Next, set the permissions on each job template, so that 'Lab-Team' has 'Admin' permissions.

* Last, create a survey, for each job template, as shown, above.
